## What is this?

This is a pet project to help manage receipts and debts between multiple parties - in a nerdy way that popular apps do not provide.

## How do I use it?

Check out the [web version](https://receipt.luixo.ru). It currently lacks onboarding, but it lacks user base as well.

Mobile version will be released some day.

## Tech stack

Based on Tanstack Start on web (and someday Expo on mobile).

Currently, mobile version is neglected until migrating to React Native components.

Web version is CD'd on Vercel.
